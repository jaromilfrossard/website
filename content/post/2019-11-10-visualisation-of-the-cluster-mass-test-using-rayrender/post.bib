First we obtain a form for both tests so that the exact tests may be carried out using the same algorithms as used for permutation tests based on the mean. Then we obtain the Bahadur slopes of the tests in these two statistics, giving numerical results for two cases equivalent to a test based on Huber scores and a particular case of this related to a median test. We show that they have different Bahadur slopes with neither exceeding the other over the whole range. Finally, we give some numerical results illustrating the robustness properties of the tests and confirming the theoretical results on Bahadur slopes.},

  abstract = {There is on-going concern about the relationship between class size and achievement for children in their first years of schooling. The Institute of Education's class size project was set up to address this issue and began recruiting in the autumn of 1996. However, because of the non-normality of achievement measures, especially in mathematics, the results have hitherto been presented by using transformed achievement measures. This makes the interpretation difficult for non-statisticians. Ideally, the data would be modelled on the original scale and a bootstrap procedure used to ensure that inferences are robust to non-normality. However, the data are multilevel. In the paper we therefore propose a nonparametric residual bootstrap procedure that is suitable for multilevel models, show that it is consistent and present a simulation study which demonstrates its potential to yield substantial reductions in the difference between nominal and actual confidence interval coverage, compared with a parametric bootstrap, when the underlying distribution of the data is non-normal. We then apply our approach to estimate the relationship between class size and achievement for children in their reception year, after adjusting for other possible determinants.},

  abstract = {AIMS: To investigate biases in overt orienting of attention to smoking-related cues in cigarette smokers, and to examine the relationship between measures of visual orienting and the affective and motivational valence of smoking cues.
DESIGN: Smokers and non-smokers took part in a single session in which their attentional and evaluative responses to smoking-related and matched control pictures were recorded.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty smokers and 25 non-smokers.
MEASUREMENTS: Direction and duration of gaze was measured while participants completed a visual probe task. Subjective and cognitive-experimental measures of the motivational and affective valence of the stimuli were recorded.
FINDINGS: Smokers, but not non-smokers, maintained their gaze for longer on smoking-related pictures than control pictures. They were also faster to detect probes that replaced smoking-related than control pictures, consistent with an attentional bias for smoking-related cues. Furthermore, smokers showed greater preferences for smoking-related than control pictures, compared with non-smokers, on both the subjective (explicit) and cognitive-experimental (implicit) indices of stimulus valence. Within smokers, longer initial fixations of gaze on smoking-related pictures were associated with a bias to rate the smoking pictures more positively, with greater approach tendencies for smoking pictures on the cognitive-experimental task, and with a greater urge to smoke.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that smokers show biased attentional orientating to smoking cues, which is related to craving and the affective and motivational valence of the stimuli.},

Next, we outline the analytical development of randomization theory by Welch and Pitman, including the latter's realization of broad possibilities for tests without distributional assumptions.

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

A general method, called the "bootstrap," is introduced, and shown to work satisfactorily on a variety of estimation problems. The jackknife is shown to be a linear approximation method for the bootstrap.

These new techniques effectively deal with four insights into when and why conventional methods can be unsatisfactory. But for the non-statistician, the vast array of new and improved techniques for comparing groups and studying associations can seem daunting, simply because there are so many new methods that are now available. This unit briefly reviews when and why conventional methods can have relatively low power and yield misleading results. The main goal is to suggest some general guidelines regarding when, how, and why certain modern techniques might be used. \textcopyright{} 2018 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

To complement the neuroscientist's toolbox, we present two powerful tools that can help us understand how groups of observations differ: the shift function and the difference asymmetry function. These tools can be combined with detailed visualisations to provide complementary perspectives about the data. We provide implementations in R and MATLAB of the graphical tools, and all the examples in the article can be reproduced using R scripts.},

  abstract = {We begin by reviewing the statistical framework of information theory as applicable to neuroimaging data analysis. A major factor hindering wider adoption of this framework in neuroimaging is the difficulty of estimating information theoretic quantities in practice. We present a novel estimation technique that combines the statistical theory of copulas with the closed form solution for the entropy of Gaussian variables. This results in a general, computationally efficient, flexible, and robust multivariate statistical framework that provides effect sizes on a common meaningful scale, allows for unified treatment of discrete, continuous, unidimensional and multidimensional variables, and enables direct comparisons of representations from behavioral and brain responses across any recording modality. We validate the use of this estimate as a statistical test within a neuroimaging context, considering both discrete stimulus classes and continuous stimulus features. We also present examples of analyses facilitated by these developments, including application of multivariate analyses to MEG planar magnetic field gradients, and pairwise temporal interactions in evoked EEG responses. We show the benefit of considering the instantaneous temporal derivative together with the raw values of M/EEG signals as a multivariate response, how we can separately quantify modulations of amplitude and direction for vector quantities, and how we can measure the emergence of novel information over time in evoked responses.

  abstract = {Intense physical exercise exerts measurable changes at various physiological levels that are well documented in the literature. However, despite the key role of the brain in processing inputs from internal organ systems and the external environment to coordinate and optimize behavior, little is known about brain dynamics during exercise. The present study investigates tonic and transient oscillatory brain activity in a group of participants performing an oddball task during a single bout of aerobic exercise. Twenty young males (19\textendash{}32 years) were recruited for two experimental sessions on separate days. EEG activity was recorded during a session of cycling at 80\% (moderate-to-high intensity) of VO2max (maximum rate of oxygen consumption) while participants responded to infrequent targets (red square and big blue circle) presented among frequent nontargets (small blue circle). This was compared to a (baseline) light intensity session (30\% VO2max) to control any potential effect of dual tasking (i.e., pedaling and performing the oddball task). A cluster-based nonparametric permutations test revealed an increase in power across the entire frequency spectrum during the moderate-to-high intensity exercise compared to light intensity. Furthermore, the more salient target (red square) elicited a lower increase in (stimulus-evoked) theta power in the 80\% VO2max than in the light intensity condition. Alpha and lower beta power decreased less in the standard trials (small blue circle) during the moderate-to-high exercise condition than in the light exercise condition. The present study unveils, for the first time, a complex brain activity pattern during vigorous exercise while attending to task-relevant stimuli.},

They elegantly handle the multiple comparisons problem in high-dimensional magnetoencephalographic and EEG data. Unfortunately, the power of this procedure comes hand in hand with the allure for unwarranted interpretations of the inferential output, the most prominent of which is the overestimation of the temporal, spatial, and frequency precision of statistical claims. This leads researchers to statements about the onset or offset of a certain effect that is not supported by the permutation test. In this article, we outline problems and common pitfalls of using and interpreting cluster-based permutation tests. We illustrate these with simulated data in order to promote a more intuitive understanding of the method. We hope that raising awareness about these issues will be beneficial to common scientific practices, while at the same time increasing the popularity of cluster-based permutation procedures.},

  abstract = {Several permutation strategies are often possible for tests of individual terms in analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) designs. These include restricted permutations, permutation of whole groups of units, permutation of some form of residuals or some combination of these. It is unclear, especially for complex designs involving random factors, mixed models or nested hierarchies, just which permutation strategy should be used for any particular test. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: (i) we provide a guideline for constructing an exact permutation strategy, where possible, for any individual term in any ANOVA design; and (ii) we provide results of Monte Carlo simulations to compare the level accuracy and power of different permutation strategies in two-way ANOVA, including random and mixed models, nested hierarchies and tests of interaction terms. Simulation results showed that permutation of residuals under a reduced model generally had greater power than the exact test or alternative approximate permutation methods (such as permutation of raw data). In several cases, restricted permutations, in particular, suffered more than other procedures, in terms of loss of power, challenging the conventional wisdom of using this approach. Our simulations also demonstrated that the choice of correct exchangeable units under the null hypothesis, in accordance with the guideline we provide, is essential for any permutation test, whether it be an exact test or an approximate test. For reference, we also provide appropriate permutation strategies for individual terms in any two-way or three-way ANOVA for the exact test (where possible) and for the approximate test using permutation of residuals.},

  abstract = {Previous studies showed that the small leftward bias found in healthy humans' spatial judgments of lines (``pseudoneglect'') shifts to the right with increasing distance between stimuli and observer. In this study, we investigated whether such a modulation of attentional asymmetry can also be observed in free visual exploration. Participants freely explored photographs of naturalistic scenes for 7 s in near (60 cm) and far (140 cm) space. After an initial leftward bias, followed by a compensatory rightward bias, gaze positions were significantly more leftward in near compared to far space (around 4 s from scene onset). Our results show that the modulation of attentional asymmetries by viewing distance previously reported for spatial judgments generalizes to free visual exploration, and we revealed the temporal dynamics of these asymmetries by fine-grained eye movement analysis. In contrast, an effect of viewing distance was reduced or absent when eye movements are under strong top-down control, as in systematic serial visual search (Sensitive Negelct Test). Finally, there was no effect of viewing distance in the landmark task (as also reported in a minority of other studies), suggesting that this effect may depend on specific, yet unidentified task characteristics.},

Down syndrome (DS) is associated with increased rates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), characterized by social-communicative impairments (SOC-COM) and repetitive behaviors and interests (RBI). However, little is known about the ASD symptom presentation in children with DS\,+\,ASD.
Aims
The current study sought to describe parent-report of SOC-COM and RBI symptoms on the Autism Diagnostic Interview -Revised (ADI-R) in children with DS (n\,=\,22), DS\,+\,ASD (n\,=\,11), and ASD (n\,=\,66).
Method
SOC-COM and RBI scores from the ADI-R were compared across the groups whose autism status was ascertained using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule.
Results
Differences in SOC-COM and RBI symptom severity was observed. The general pattern of findings was ASD\,{$>$}\,DS+ASD\,{$>$}\,DS. Dissimilar ASD symptom profiles were observed across groups. In ASD, SOC-COM scores were higher than RBI scores; in DS\,+\,ASD, similar SOC-COM and RBI scores were observed. Lastly, SOC-COM impairments were highly related to verbal cognition in youth with DS\,+\,ASD but not in those with DS or ASD.
Conclusions and Implications
These findings suggest that children with DS\,+\,ASD have a distinct profile of ASD symptoms that differs from peers with either disorder in isolation. Thus, care should be taken in evaluating and designing treatments for this group.},

  abstract = {The design of experiments in psychology can often be summarized to participants reacting to stimuli. For such an experiment, the mixed effects model with crossed random effects is usually the appropriate tool to analyse the data because it considers the sampling of both participants and stimuli. However, these models let to users several choices when analysing data and this practice may be disruptive for researchers trained to a set of standardized analysis such as ANOVA. In the present article, we are focusing on the choice of the correlation structure of the data, because it is both subtle and influential on the results of the analysis. We provide an overview of several correlation structures used in the literature and we propose a new one that is the natural extension of the repeated measures ANOVA. A large simulation study shows that correlation structures that are either too simple or too complex fail to deliver credible results, even for designs with only three variables. We also show how the design of the experiment influences the correlation structure of the data. Moreover, we provide R code to estimate all the correlation structures presented in this article, as well as functions implemented in an R package to compute our new proposal.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the performance of the most popular bootstrap schemes for multilevel data. Also, we propose a modified version of the wild bootstrap procedure for hierarchical data structures. The wild bootstrap does not require homoscedasticity or assumptions on the distribution of the error processes. Hence, it is a valuable tool for robust inference in a multilevel framework. We assess the finite size performances of the schemes through a Monte Carlo study. The results show that for big sample sizes it always pays off to adopt an agnostic approach as the wild bootstrap outperforms other techniques.},

  abstract = {Mixed-effects models are being used ever more frequently in the analysis of experimental data. However, in the lme4 package in R the standards for evaluating significance of fixed effects in these models (i.e., obtaining p-values) are somewhat vague. There are good reasons for this, but as researchers who are using these models are required in many cases to report p-values, some method for evaluating the significance of the model output is needed. This paper reports the results of simulations showing that the two most common methods for evaluating significance, using likelihood ratio tests and applying the z distribution to the Wald t values from the model output (t-as-z), are somewhat anti-conservative, especially for smaller sample sizes. Other methods for evaluating significance, including parametric bootstrapping and the Kenward-Roger and Satterthwaite approximations for degrees of freedom, were also evaluated. The results of these simulations suggest that Type 1 error rates are closest to .05 when models are fitted using REML and p-values are derived using the Kenward-Roger or Satterthwaite approximations, as these approximations both produced acceptable Type 1 error rates even for smaller samples.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest and activity in the general area of nonparametric smoothing in statistics. This monograph concentrates on the roughness penalty method and shows how this technique provides a unifying approach to a wide range of smoothing problems. The method allows parametric assumptions to be realized in regression problems, in those approached by generalized linear modelling, and in many other contexts.The emphasis throughout is methodological rather than theoretical, and it concentrates on statistical and computation issues. Real data examples are used to illustrate the various methods and to compare them with standard parametric approaches. Some publicly available software is also discussed. The mathematical treatment is self-contained and depends mainly on simple linear algebra and calculus.This monograph will be useful both as a reference work for research and applied statisticians and as a text for graduate students and other encountering the material for the first time.},

  volume = {29},
  issn = {0003-4851},
  abstract = {[Methods are given for constructing sets of simultaneous confidence intervals for the means of variables which follow a multivariate normal distribution. In section (3), a set of confidence intervals is obtained for each of two special cases; first when the variances are assumed to be known, and second when the variances are assumed to be equal. These two sets have the property that the confidence is known exactly, rather than merely being bounded below. In the case of known variances, the intervals are of fixed lengths (i.e., the lengths are the same from sample to sample); when the variances are unknown, the intervals are of variable lengths. It may be surprising to note that nothing need be known about the covariances in order to obtain confidence intervals of fixed lengths whose confidence coefficient is exact. These intervals are long, and do not make use of all the information provided by the sample. Each of sections (4) to (7) considers a different method for obtaining confidence intervals of bounded confidence level. In each section a set of fixed lengths is obtained when the variances are assumed to be known, while a set of variable lengths is obtained when the variances are unknown but equal. In section (5) the set of variable lengths applies to the general multivariate normal distribution, all the other confidence intervals in this paper require some assumption concerning the variances. In section (8) the sets of intervals are compared on the basis of length. One of the bounded confidence level methods, which has been established only for two or three variables or for an arbitrary number of variables with a special type of correlation matrix, is shown to yield the best possible set. Another of the bounded confidence level methods, whose use is established in general, is shown to be almost as good as the best set for confidence coefficients of practical interest. It is interesting to notice that intervals with bounded confidence level, are found which are much shorter than the ones whose confidence level is exact. This need not surprise us, however. In the case of just one variable, we might easily find hat the 95\% confidence intervals for the mean using the \$t\$-statistic were shorter on the average than 94\% confidence intervals using order statistics. Moreover, since in admitting sets of confidence intervals with bounded confidence level we consider a much broader class of methods, we might almost expect that some of them would give better intervals.]},

These approaches are evaluated from the perspective of electrophysiological studies, which involve multivariate (i.e., spatiotemporal) observations in which source-level signals are picked up to a certain extent by all sensors. Besides formal statistical techniques, there are also techniques that do not involve probability calculations but are very useful in dealing with multivariate data (i.e., verification of data-based predictions, cross-validation, and localizers). Moreover, data-based decision making can also be informed by mechanistic evidence that is provided by the structure in the data.},

When participants responded to stimulus valence, the manikin task was more sensitive to valence than the joystick task (Experiment 1). When participants responded to the grammatical category of valent words, the manikin and the feedback-joystick but not the joystick task were sensitive to valence (Experiment 2). Finally, the manikin task was more sensitive than the feedback-joystick task in assessing approach\textendash{}avoidance reactions towards spiders, and it was more strongly related to self-reported fear of spiders (Experiment 3).

  title = {Accounting for Stimulus and Participant Effects in Event-Related Potential Analyses to Increase the Replicability of Studies},
  volume = {309},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Event-related potentials (ERPs) are increasingly used in cognitive science. With their high temporal resolution, they offer a unique window into cognitive processes and their time course. In this paper, we focus on ERP experiments whose designs involve selecting participants and stimuli amongst many. Recently, Westfall et al. (2017) highlighted the drastic consequences of not considering stimuli as a random variable in fMRI studies with such designs. Most ERP studies in cognitive psychology suffer from the same drawback.
NEW METHOD: We advocate the use of the Quasi-F or Mixed-effects models instead of the classical ANOVA/by-participant F1 statistic to analyze ERP datasets in which the dependent variable is reduced to one measure per trial (e.g., mean amplitude). We combine Quasi-F statistic and cluster mass tests to analyze datasets with multiple measures per trial. Doing so allows us to treat stimulus as a random variable while correcting for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: Simulations show that the use of Quasi-F statistics with cluster mass tests allows maintaining the family wise error rates close to the nominal alpha level of 0.05.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Simulations reveal that the classical ANOVA/F1 approach has an alarming FWER, demonstrating the superiority of models that treat both participant and stimulus as random variables, like the Quasi-F approach.
CONCLUSIONS: Our simulations question the validity of studies in which stimulus is not treated as a random variable. Failure to change the current standards feeds the replicability crisis.},

The standard approximate intervals based on maximum likelihood theory, \texttheta\^ {$\pm$} {$\sigma\hat$}z\textsuperscript{({$\alpha$})}, can be quite misleading. In practice, tricks based on transformations, bias corrections, and so forth, are often used to improve their accuracy. The bootstrap confidence intervals discussed in this article automatically incorporate such tricks without requiring the statistician to think them through for each new application, at the price of a considerable increase in computational effort. The new intervals incorporate an improvement over previously suggested methods, which results in second-order correctness in a wide variety of problems. In addition to parametric families, bootstrap intervals are also developed for nonparametric situations.},

  abstract = {Detecting outliers in a multivariate point cloud is not trivial, especially when there are several outliers. The classical identification method does not always find them, because it is based on the sample mean and covariance matrix, which are themselves affected by the outliers. That is how the outliers get masked. To avoid the masking effect, we propose to compute distances based on very robust estimates of location and covariance. These robust distances are better suited to expose the outliers. In the case of regression data, the classical least squares approach masks outliers in a similar way. Also here, the outliers may be unmasked by using a highly robust regression method. Finally, a new display is proposed in which the robust regression residuals are plotted versus the robust distances. This plot classifies the data into regular observations, vertical outliers, good leverage points, and bad leverage points. Several examples are discussed.},
