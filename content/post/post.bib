This new edition of the bestselling Randomization, Bootstrap and Monte Carlo Methods in Biology illustrates the value of a number of these methods with an emphasis on biological applications. This textbook focuses on three related areas in computational statistics: randomization, bootstrapping, and Monte Carlo methods of inference. The author emphasizes the sampling approach within randomization testing and confidence intervals. Similar to randomization, the book shows how bootstrapping, or resampling, can be used for confidence intervals and tests of significance. It also explores how to use Monte Carlo methods to test hypotheses and construct confidence intervals.New to the Third EditionUpdated information on regression and time series analysis, multivariate methods, survival and growth data as well as software for computational statisticsReferences that reflect recent developments in methodology and computing techniquesAdditional references on new applications of computer-intensive methods in biologyProviding comprehensive coverage of computer-intensive applications while also offering data sets online, Randomization, Bootstrap and Monte Carlo Methods in Biology, Third Edition supplies a solid foundation for the ever-expanding field of statistics and quantitative analysis in biology.},

Such a data structure is typical in social network studies, where variables indicate some type of relation between a given set of actors. We present a new permutation method (called “double semi-partialing”, or DSP) that complements the family of extant approaches to MRQAP tests. We assess the statistical bias (type I error rate) and statistical power of the set of five methods, including DSP, across a variety of conditions of network autocorrelation, of spuriousness (size of confounder effect), and of skewness in the data. These conditions are explored across three assumed data distributions: normal, gamma, and negative binomial. We find that the Freedman–Lane method and the DSP method are the most robust against a wide array of these conditions. We also find that all five methods perform better if the test statistic is pivotal. Finally, we find limitations of usefulness for MRQAP tests: All tests degrade under simultaneous conditions of extreme skewness and high spuriousness for gamma and negative binomial distributions.},

The results are then applied to determine the effect of group-to-group inequality of variance in the one-way classification. It appears that if the groups are equal, moderate inequality of variance does not seriously affect the test. However, with unequal groups, much larger discrepancies appear. In a second paper, similar methods are used to determine the effect of inequality of variance and serial correlation between errors in the two-way classification.},

The method can be seen as an alternative to the analytic method of Dunnett and Tamhane, which requires a specific distributional form. Resampling incorporates the covariance structure of the data without the need for distributional assumptions. Recent work by Westfall and Young has shown that a step-down resampling method is asymptotically consistent when adjusted p values can be obtained exactly for continuous data. This article shows that in the case of a comparison of two groups on multiple outcomes, those results are generalizable to discrete data where exact adjusted p values are not available. It is shown that the method asymptotically attains the desired level for controlling the experimentwise probability of a type I error.},

Nonparametric statistical tests offer complete freedom to the user with respect to the test statistic by means of which the experimental conditions are compared. This freedom provides a straightforward way to solve the multiple comparisons problem (MCP) and it allows to incorporate biophysically motivated constraints in the test statistic, which may drastically increase the sensitivity of the statistical test. The paper is written for two audiences: (1) empirical neuroscientists looking for the most appropriate data analysis method, and (2) methodologists interested in the theoretical concepts behind nonparametric statistical tests. For the empirical neuroscientist, a large part of the paper is written in a tutorial-like fashion, enabling neuroscientists to construct their own statistical test, maximizing the sensitivity to the expected effect. And for the methodologist, it is explained why the nonparametric test is formally correct. This means that we formulate a null hypothesis (identical probability distribution in the different experimental conditions) and show that the nonparametric test controls the false alarm rate under this null hypothesis.},

It also discusses factorial designs and interactions and combines repeated-measures and randomized block designs in one chapter. The authors focus more attention on the practicality of N-of-1 randomization tests and the availability of user-friendly software to perform them. In addition, they provide an overview of free and commercial computer programs for all of the tests presented in the book.     Building on the previous editions that have served as standard textbooks for more than twenty-five years, Randomization Tests, Fourth Edition includes a CD-ROM of up-to-date randomization test programs that facilitate application of the tests to experimental data.

Many investigators seem to assume that generalization to both the subject population and the language as a whole is automatically ensured if separate subject (F1) and item (F2) analyses are performed and that the null hypothesis may safely be rejected if these F values are both significant. Such a procedure is, however, unfounded and not in accordance with the recommendations of Clark (1973). More importantly and contrary to current practice, in many cases there is no need to perform separate subject and item analyses since the traditional F1 is the correct test statistic. In particular this is the case when item variability is experimentally controlled by matching or by counterbalancing.},

The parameters in these models are typically estimated by maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood. In general, there is no closed-form solution for these estimates and they must be determined by iterative algorithms such as EM iterations or general nonlinear optimization. Many of the intermediate calculations for such iterations have been expressed as generalized least squares problems. We show that an alternative representation as a penalized least squares problem has many advantageous computational properties including the ability to evaluate explicitly a profiled log-likelihood or log-restricted likelihood, the gradient and Hessian of this profiled objective, and an ECME update to refine this objective.},

Distributions of test statistics based on mixed models fitted to such data are unknown, but two recently developed methods for approximating the distributions of test statistics in mixed linear models have been included as options in the latest release of the MIXED procedure of SAS®. One method (FC, from Fai and Cornelius) computes degrees of freedom of an approximating F distribution for the test statistic using spectral decomposition of the hypothesis matrix together with repeated application of a method for single-degree-of-freedom tests. The other method (KR, from Kenward and Roger) adjusts the estimated covariance matrix of the parameter estimates, computes a scale adjustment to the test statistic, and computes the degrees of freedom of an approximating F distribution. Using the two methods, p values for a hypothesis of interest in the lady beetle study were quite different. Simulation studies on the Proc MIXED implementation of these methods showed that Type I error rates of both methods are affected by covariance structure complexity, sample size, and imbalance. Nonetheless, the KR method performs well in situations with fairly complicated covariance structures when sample sizes are moderate to small and the design is reasonably balanced. The KR method should be used in preference to the FC method, although it had inflated Type I error rates for complex covariance structures combined with small sample sizes.},

This groundbreaking book shows how to apply modern resampling techniques to mathematical statistics. Extensively class-tested to ensure an accessible presentation, Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R utilizes the powerful and flexible computer language R to underscore the significance and benefits of modern resampling techniques. The book begins by introducing permutation tests and bootstrap methods, motivating classical inference methods. Striking a balance between theory, computing, and applications, the authors explore additional topics such as:  Exploratory data analysis Calculation of sampling distributions The Central Limit Theorem Monte Carlo sampling Maximum likelihood estimation and properties of estimators Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests Regression Bayesian methods  Throughout the book, case studies on diverse subjects such as flight delays, birth weights of babies, and telephone company repair times illustrate the relevance of the real-world applications of the discussed material. Key definitions and theorems of important probability distributions are collected at the end of the book, and a related website is also available, featuring additional material including data sets, R scripts, and helpful teaching hints. Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R is an excellent book for courses on mathematical statistics at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels.
