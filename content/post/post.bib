Such a data structure is typical in social network studies, where variables indicate some type of relation between a given set of actors. We present a new permutation method (called “double semi-partialing”, or DSP) that complements the family of extant approaches to MRQAP tests. We assess the statistical bias (type I error rate) and statistical power of the set of five methods, including DSP, across a variety of conditions of network autocorrelation, of spuriousness (size of confounder effect), and of skewness in the data. These conditions are explored across three assumed data distributions: normal, gamma, and negative binomial. We find that the Freedman–Lane method and the DSP method are the most robust against a wide array of these conditions. We also find that all five methods perform better if the test statistic is pivotal. Finally, we find limitations of usefulness for MRQAP tests: All tests degrade under simultaneous conditions of extreme skewness and high spuriousness for gamma and negative binomial distributions.},

The method can be seen as an alternative to the analytic method of Dunnett and Tamhane, which requires a specific distributional form. Resampling incorporates the covariance structure of the data without the need for distributional assumptions. Recent work by Westfall and Young has shown that a step-down resampling method is asymptotically consistent when adjusted p values can be obtained exactly for continuous data. This article shows that in the case of a comparison of two groups on multiple outcomes, those results are generalizable to discrete data where exact adjusted p values are not available. It is shown that the method asymptotically attains the desired level for controlling the experimentwise probability of a type I error.},

	abstract = {Background
In recent years, analyses of event related potentials/fields have moved from the selection of a few components and peaks to a mass-univariate approach in which the whole data space is analyzed. Such extensive testing increases the number of false positives and correction for multiple comparisons is needed.

Method
Here we review all cluster-based correction for multiple comparison methods (cluster-height, cluster-size, cluster-mass, and threshold free cluster enhancement – TFCE), in conjunction with two computational approaches (permutation and bootstrap).

Results
Data driven Monte-Carlo simulations comparing two conditions within subjects (two sample Student's t-test) showed that, on average, all cluster-based methods using permutation or bootstrap alike control well the family-wise error rate (FWER), with a few caveats.

Conclusions
(i) A minimum of 800 iterations are necessary to obtain stable results; (ii) below 50 trials, bootstrap methods are too conservative; (iii) for low critical family-wise error rates (e.g. p = 1\%), permutations can be too liberal; (iv) TFCE controls best the type 1 error rate with an attenuated extent parameter (i.e. power {\textless} 1).},

Nonparametric statistical tests offer complete freedom to the user with respect to the test statistic by means of which the experimental conditions are compared. This freedom provides a straightforward way to solve the multiple comparisons problem (MCP) and it allows to incorporate biophysically motivated constraints in the test statistic, which may drastically increase the sensitivity of the statistical test. The paper is written for two audiences: (1) empirical neuroscientists looking for the most appropriate data analysis method, and (2) methodologists interested in the theoretical concepts behind nonparametric statistical tests. For the empirical neuroscientist, a large part of the paper is written in a tutorial-like fashion, enabling neuroscientists to construct their own statistical test, maximizing the sensitivity to the expected effect. And for the methodologist, it is explained why the nonparametric test is formally correct. This means that we formulate a null hypothesis (identical probability distribution in the different experimental conditions) and show that the nonparametric test controls the false alarm rate under this null hypothesis.},

Several permutation strategies have been proposed by others to obtain a distribution-free test for factors in a fixed effect ANOVA (i.e., single error term ANOVA). The resulting tests are either approximate or exact. However, there exists no universal exact permutation test which can be applied to an arbitrary design to test a desired factor. An exact permutation strategy applicable to fixed effect analysis of variance is presented. The proposed method can be used to test any factor, even in the presence of higher-order interactions. In addition, the method has the advantage of being applicable in unbalanced designs (all-cell-filled), which is a very common situation in practice, and it is the first method with this capability. Simulation studies show that the proposed method has an actual level which stays remarkably close to the nominal level, and its power is always competitive. This is the case even with very small datasets, strongly unbalanced designs and non-Gaussian errors. No other competitor show such an enviable behavior.},

	abstract = {The ANOVA method and permutation tests, two heritages of Fisher, have been extensively studied. Several permutation strategies have been proposed by others to obtain a distribution-free test for factors in a fixed effect ANOVA (i.e., single error term ANOVA). The resulting tests are either approximate or exact. However, there exists no universal exact permutation test which can be applied to an arbitrary design to test a desired factor. An exact permutation strategy applicable to fixed effect analysis of variance is presented. The proposed method can be used to test any factor, even in the presence of higher-order interactions. In addition, the method has the advantage of being applicable in unbalanced designs (all-cell-filled), which is a very common situation in practice, and it is the first method with this capability. Simulation studies show that the proposed method has an actual level which stays remarkably close to the nominal level, and its power is always competitive. This is the case even with very small datasets, strongly unbalanced designs and non-Gaussian errors. No other competitor show such an enviable behavior.},

It also discusses factorial designs and interactions and combines repeated-measures and randomized block designs in one chapter.

In addition, they provide an overview of free and commercial computer programs for all of the tests presented in the book.     Building on the previous editions that have served as standard textbooks for more than twenty-five years, Randomization Tests, Fourth Edition includes a CD-ROM of up-to-date randomization test programs that facilitate application of the tests to experimental data.

The parameters in these models are typically estimated by maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood. In general, there is no closed-form solution for these estimates and they must be determined by iterative algorithms such as EM iterations or general nonlinear optimization. Many of the intermediate calculations for such iterations have been expressed as generalized least squares problems. We show that an alternative representation as a penalized least squares problem has many advantageous computational properties including the ability to evaluate explicitly a profiled log-likelihood or log-restricted likelihood, the gradient and Hessian of this profiled objective, and an ECME update to refine this objective.},

This groundbreaking book shows how to apply modern resampling techniques to mathematical statistics. Extensively class-tested to ensure an accessible presentation, Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R utilizes the powerful and flexible computer language R to underscore the significance and benefits of modern resampling techniques. The book begins by introducing permutation tests and bootstrap methods, motivating classical inference methods. Striking a balance between theory, computing, and applications, the authors explore additional topics such as:  Exploratory data analysis Calculation of sampling distributions The Central Limit Theorem Monte Carlo sampling Maximum likelihood estimation and properties of estimators Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests Regression Bayesian methods  Throughout the book, case studies on diverse subjects such as flight delays, birth weights of babies, and telephone company repair times illustrate the relevance of the real-world applications of the discussed material. Key definitions and theorems of important probability distributions are collected at the end of the book, and a related website is also available, featuring additional material including data sets, R scripts, and helpful teaching hints. Mathematical Statistics with Resampling and R is an excellent book for courses on mathematical statistics at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It also serves as a valuable reference for applied statisticians working in the areas of business, economics, biostatistics, and public health who utilize resampling methods in their everyday work.},
