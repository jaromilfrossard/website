permuco is an R package that provide user and simple way to compute permutation test for for ANOVA, regression parameters and repeated measures ANOVA. Several methods of permutation to handel nuisances variables are implemented like Freedman and Lane, Huh-Jhun an Dekker. An extension for massive univariate tests that implements cluster-mass statistics, the threshold-free cluster-enhancement and several other multiple comparison procedures is implemented. This extension allows to computed intuitively tests of difference of amplitude on signals for EEG data analysis.
